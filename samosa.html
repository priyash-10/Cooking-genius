<h3> RECIPE OF SAMOSA IS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt.<br>
Add the oil or ghee and mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.<br>
Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br>
<li>Make the Filling:</li>
Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin and mustard seeds, and let them splutter.<br>
Add the mashed potatoes and green peas.<br>
Add all the spices (coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, turmeric, red chili powder) and salt. Mix well.<br>
Cook for a few minutes until everything is well combined. Add fresh coriander leaves and mix. Let the filling cool.<br>
<li>Shape the Samosas:</li>
Divide the dough into small balls. Roll each ball into an oval shape.<br>
Cut the oval in half to form two semi-circles.<br>
Take one semi-circle and form a cone by folding it and sealing the edge with water.<br>
Fill the cone with the potato mixture and seal the top edge with water.<br>
Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.<br>
<li>Fry the Samosas:</li>
Heat oil in a deep pan over medium heat.<br>
Fry the samosas in batches until they are golden brown and crispy.<br>
Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.<br>
